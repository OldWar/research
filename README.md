### Hello, 

This is our public repository. 
Here we're going to publish some reversing and code emulating info to help other developers in this. 

This repository is used for code&documentation purpose. We are working on packet reversing of G. W. and emulating the test server. 
Note that this is currently accessible to everyone, but this research is made by our team and you cannot present this information as your own.

We can't open all research and code at once, as far as we're still working on it. So, we're going to do it for some time.
The latest news you can find at our [VK group](http://vk.com/guildwars2_oldwar).
